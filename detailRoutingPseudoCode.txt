1. From home page, detail page will be loaded and query will be passed to detail page.
2. From detail page, could go back to home page
3. From detail page, if border country link is clicked, will be redirected yo home page where the countries data resides. 
   A query with redirect=true will be passed to home page so it will immediately redirect to detail page of the clicked border country.
   (This will avoid the need of loading the full countries data on each country detail page. The redirect will be almost instantaneous and will not be noticeable).
